# Face Detection and Recognition using face-api

Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time. Face Detection detects the faces by returning the respective x and y coordinates of the top left corner along with the height and width of the box that encloses the face in an image or video. It plays a major role in the field of computer vision. There are several api or libraries that help to make a face detection and face recognition model in just a few lines of code. To make such algorithms run on the edge devices and without the intervention of a server we implement such a model on javascript. Face detection and face recognition have a large number of applications. Today we will be implementing a face recognition model using the face-api to detect all the faces and draw a bounding box around each detected face and label them.

# Project Stucture

The ‘Face Recognition face-api’ directory contains the above-shown files. The content of each file or directory is discussed below.
* /models: This directory contains the required JSON and binary files of the models which we will be used for facial recognition.

* /index.html : the html file for the webpage

* /script.js : the javascript file

* /face-api.min.js: the javascript file of the face-api that is required to work with the tiny face detector model

* /Images: contains the reference images in respective folders with labels


# Run the Project
